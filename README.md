# Instagram Follower Checker

The "Instagram Follower Checker" is a web application designed to address a common social media challenge faced by college students and social networkers alike. During each semester, students often connect with numerous peers on platforms like Instagram. However, keeping track of these connections can be challenging, especially when some individuals unfollow without notice. This project provides a solution for anyone looking to easily identify one-sided follower relationships on Instagram.

## Preliminary Setup

**Download Data from Instagram:** To use the Instagram Follower Checker, users need to first download their followers and following lists in JSON format from Instagram. Here's how to do it:

1. **Access Data Download Feature**: Navigate to the "Your Activity" section in your Instagram account settings and find the **Data Download** feature.
2. **Request Data**: Submit a request to download your account information.
3. **Upload to the App**: Once you receive and download your data, upload the `followers_1.json` and `following.json` files to the Instagram Follower Checker website.
